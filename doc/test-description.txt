Running the tests
-------------------------------------------

You must be located in the "test/" folder. The binary file named "dka-2-mka" is in parent folder.

$ ./tester.sh (-i|-t)

Option -i is used to test correctness of saving DFA to the internal representation
and print it to standard output, in case of incorrect format of DFA, suffix -bad is added
to filenames, tester.sh checks, if error in DFA was detected.

With option -t, DFAs from files are minimized and minimal DFA is printed to standard output.
