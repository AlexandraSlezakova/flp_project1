Running the tests
-------------------------------------------

You must be located in the "test/" folder

$ ./tester.sh (-i|-t)

Option -i is used to test correctness of saving DFA to the internal representation
and print it to standard output. With option -t, DFA from files are minimized
and minimal DFA is printed to standard output.
